# simple-chess-game
Chess game built in python using tkinter graphics library. 
Instructions:
Decide player colours. When it is your turn, left click to select a piece of correct colour, right click a highlighted location to move there.

This simple chess game was programmed in collaboration with Amadej Kocbek.

Current features:
En passant.
Castling.
Transformations of pawns into queens at end of board.
Highlighting selected piece and valid moves.

Future additions to be made:
Update pawn transformations to enable transforming into pieces other than a queen when reaching end of the board.
Adjust mouse clicks to use left click both times.
Add options for draws which are not yet integrated into the GUI.

Note: button binding may differ between devices, in particular button-2 and button-3 may be different for some mice.
